    "# HL7 Version 2 (V2)\n",
    " - HL7 Version 2 is one of the most widely adopted standards for electronic health information exchange. It focuses on clinical, administrative, and financial data.\n",
    " - It uses a **pipe-delimited** format for messaging, with each message representing a healthcare transaction (e.g., patient admission, lab results, orders, etc.).\n",
    " - While widely used, V2 is flexible and often customized for different healthcare institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# HL7 Version 3 (V3)\n",
    " - HL7 Version 3 is a more structured and formal version of the standard, based on the **XML format**.\n",
    " - It includes a model for the specification of healthcare information, which aims to reduce ambiguity and improve interoperability.\n",
    " - HL7 V3 messages are much more rigid and provide clearer specifications compared to V2.\n",

    "# CDA (Clinical Document Architecture)\n",
    " - CDA is a part of HL7's Version 3 standard and is used for encoding clinical documents like discharge summaries, progress notes, and diagnostic reports.\n",
    " - It uses the XML format and allows for structured, consistent, and interoperable representation of healthcare documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "# HL7 Messaging Standards\n",
    " - HL7 messages consist of **segments** (e.g., patient demographics, observation results) and **fields** (individual pieces of data within a segment).\n",
    " - The most commonly used message types are **ADT (Admit, Discharge, Transfer)**, **ORM (Order)**, **ORU (Observation Result)**, and **VXU (Vaccination Update)**.\n",
