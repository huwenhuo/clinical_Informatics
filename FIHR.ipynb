    "# Introduction to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)\n",
    "\n",
    "**FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)** is a standard developed by **HL7 (Health Level Seven International)** for exchanging healthcare information electronically. It is designed to be **simple, flexible, and easy to implement**, enabling seamless data exchange between different healthcare systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features of FHIR\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Resource-Based Model**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *   Data is organized into **resources** (e.g., Patient, Observation, Medication).\n",
    "    *   Each resource is a small, reusable unit of information with a unique identifier.\n",
    "2.  **RESTful API Support**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *   Uses standard **HTTP methods** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for data exchange.\n",
    "    *   Supports modern web technologies like JSON and XML.\n",
    "3.  **Interoperability**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *   Enables different healthcare systems (EHRs, mobile apps, etc.) to communicate easily.\n",
    "    *   Supports standardized terminologies like **SNOMED CT, LOINC, and ICD-10**.\n",
    "4.  **Flexibility & Extensibility**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *   Allows customization through **extensions and profiles** without breaking core functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## FHIR Resource Example (Patient)\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic FHIR **Patient** resource in JSON:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Why Use FHIR?\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Simplifies data exchange** between hospitals, clinics, and apps.\n",
    "*   **Reduces integration costs** with a standardized format.\n",
    "*   **Supports real-time data sharing** for better patient care.\n",
