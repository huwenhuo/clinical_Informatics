    "**SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine – Clinical Terms)** is a **comprehensive, multilingual clinical terminology** used in healthcare to standardize medical concepts across different systems. It is maintained by **SNOMED International** and is widely used in **Electronic Health Records (EHRs), decision support systems, and clinical research**.\n",

    "# Key Features of SNOMED CT\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Rich Hierarchical Structure** – Concepts are organized in a logical structure with relationships (e.g., \"Diabetes mellitus\" is a type of \"Endocrine disorder\").\n",
    "2.  **Unique Identifiers** – Each clinical term has a unique code, ensuring consistency across healthcare systems.\n",
    "3.  **Interoperability** – Works with **LOINC, ICD-10, RxNorm, and FHIR** to standardize medical data exchange.\n",
    "4.  **Global Adoption** – Used in over 50 countries for clinical documentation, decision support, and data analytics.\n",
