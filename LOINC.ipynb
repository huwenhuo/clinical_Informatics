    "**LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes)** is a standardized system for identifying **laboratory tests, clinical observations, and measurements** in healthcare. It was developed by **Regenstrief Institute** to improve interoperability between healthcare systems by providing a common language for test results and observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Key Uses of LOINC:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Laboratory Tests** – Standardizes codes for blood tests, microbiology results, etc.\n",
    "2.  **Clinical Observations** – Captures vital signs, survey instruments, and patient assessments.\n",
    "3.  **Public Health & Research** – Helps in data exchange between hospitals, research institutions, and public health agencies.\n",
    "4.  **Electronic Health Records (EHRs)** – Used to ensure consistent data representation across different systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   LOINC Code **718-7** → **Hemoglobin \\[Mass/volume\\] in Blood**\n",
    "*   LOINC Code **8867-4** → **Heart rate (Pulse)**\n",
